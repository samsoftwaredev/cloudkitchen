## An Optimized Table

I wrote this code as part of a coding challenge.

## Getting Started

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables

```
  NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
  NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV=development
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
